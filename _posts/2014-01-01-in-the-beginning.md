> Who am I?

Sorpa'as reasized himself in a dark place. He had nothing to stand on, but he did not fall. He can speak, but he cannot hear.

It is always the most difficult time when one first realize his place. Will there be time and speace, or just a vacant place for one to spend for the rest of his life? Sorpa'as did not know, and he also know nothing about dangers and sadness. "I just want a world", Sorpa'as thought, with his sound echoing in the vacant. He said it loudly, again and again.

No answer, of course.

How vacant can reply to a willing mind! Magic will never happen if you do wrong things at wrong time in the wrong place.

Sorpa'as finally stopped, leaving the vacant world lonely, and himself lonely. He started to study himself. If there is something else in the world, how could he interact with them? Does he have legs and hand? Can he feel? And was he really shouting, or just echos in his mind?

Sorpa'as stopped trying. He cannot see, of course. However, he can think at least. How great it is if there is something he can see, how amazing if he could find a world to live in! He found his eyes, and closed them. "There is a colorful world", he thought, "a green and blue and brown world. And let's call the blue things sky, the green things ground, and the brown things houses."

Sorpa'as love this world, so he continues thinking, "let the sky be not only blue, but with changing colors, and let there be some white things, and let them move in the sky. Let's call the white things clouds."

Sorpa'as became amazed, and he thought, "let there be things that is invisible, and let them move in the world, and influence any other things in the world. And I call them winds."

"Let there be vivid things with no color, but once one see it, one know it. I want to call it water. And let there be other colors decorating the ground. Ane I call it flowers."

"And let the ground be rough. And I call the higher places mountains, and lower places the valley. And let the house be in the valley."

"Finally let me have eyes, hands and legs. And I call myself a human."

Sorpa'as feel content. The world is vivid to him. He can feel his hands and legs. He enjoyed the wind. He saw the blue sky and the green ground. "Prairie", Sorpa'as said. He found himself behind his house in the valley, and the mountains so huge beyond his imagination.

Sorpa'as enjoyed it. He stopped imagining. "Is it real or just exist in my dream?" Sorpa'as thought. He closed his eyes for minutes, and opened it again, the world is still there.

He felt surprised, and the world did never disappear.
